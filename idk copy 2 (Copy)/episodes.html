                        <h2 class="char">Episode 1 - "An Unexpected Event"</h2>
                        <p>One summer morning in Gardenia, Bloom’s mother, Vanessa, wakes her up for school as a prank, even though it’s summer vacation. She finds a fairy book Bloom was reading and dismisses it as silly, suggesting Bloom should help in the shop instead. Bloom refuses, and after receiving a new bicycle as a gift, she heads to the park, where she encounters Mitzi, who mocks Bloom's choice of vacation spots. While there, Bloom's pet rabbit Kiko discovers a fairy named Stella behind some bushes, fighting off ghouls.</p>
                        <p>As Stella battles the ghouls, Bloom intervenes and discovers she has magical powers, using a force field to defend Stella. Together, they defeat the monsters, but Stella collapses, and Knut reports back to his mistresses with a piece of Bloom’s clothes. Stella awakens in Bloom's living room and explains she’s a fairy from Solaria, traveling to Alfea. Though Bloom’s father, Mike, refuses to believe her, Bloom realizes her own fairy abilities when Stella shows her how to use magic.</p>
                        <p>That night, the ghouls and a troll return to hunt Bloom. Stella transports Bloom through a magical postcard to the realm of Alfea, but Bloom is unsure about leaving her life behind. The ghouls find the house, and after a battle with Stella’s help, Bloom lures the monsters out and assists in their defeat. The specialists—Sky, Brandon, Riven, and Timmy—arrive to save them, and Bloom, now convinced, agrees to join Stella at Alfea. Bloom’s family is transported to the Magic Dimension, where they head toward the school together.</p>

                <h2 class="char">Episode 2 - "Welcome to Magix!"</h2>
                <p>Bloom and Stella arrive at Alfea, but Bloom's parents can't enter due to the barrier surrounding the school. After a heartfelt goodbye, Stella sends them home and takes Bloom across the barrier. Once inside, they meet Griselda, who tells them about the school rules and reveals that Stella was expelled for an accident involving a potion lab. Headmistress Faragonda arrives and gives an inspirational speech, warning the students about the Witches of Cloud Tower, before dismissing everyone to their rooms.</p>
                <p>As Bloom heads to her room, she meets her roommate, Flora, and almost reveals her true identity but quickly corrects herself, claiming to be Varanda. The girls—Tecna, Flora, Bloom, Stella, and Musa—get to know each other, and Stella suggests they go to dinner in the city. Meanwhile, Griselda spies on them, and Knut appears, being ordered to steal Stella’s scepter. Bloom follows Knut into an alley, where she is ambushed by the Trix. They trap her in ice and attack, but Bloom's friends transform into fairies and defeat the ogre sent to attack them.</p>
                <p>Afterward, the Trix’s power overwhelms the girls, and Stella transports them to safety. The others soon discover Stella’s lie about Bloom’s identity, and Faragonda and Griselda catch her as well. Bloom must convince them she belongs, and after proving she has the qualities of a fairy, Faragonda allows her to stay. The girls then decide to form a group, naming themselves the Winx, based on Bloom’s suggestion.</p>

                <p>Professor Wizgiz demonstrates a magical transformation, impressing the students. He then gives them mirrors to practice changing their hair color, but Bloom struggles while the others succeed. Flora comforts Bloom, and the girls share their dreams, with Stella talking about her parents and Flora expressing her desire to learn. At breakfast, Faragonda announces the annual ball and the upcoming gift exchange with the Specialists from Red Fountain. Classes are canceled for the day as the students prepare for the event.</p>
                <p>The Winx girls plan for the ball, and Stella takes Bloom shopping in Magix City for a dress. Bloom finds an affordable one, but after using her powers to fix it, she accidentally sets it on fire. Meanwhile, the Trix are plotting to sabotage the ball and cast a spell on enchanted eggs that will hatch snake-rats when touched by a fairy. Bloom overhears their plan and warns her friends, who counteract the spell. During the ball, Prince Sky gives Stella an egg, and Musa and Flora secretly prepare a plan to get back at the Trix.</p>
                <p>As the Trix steal Stella's ring, Bloom transforms into a fairy for the first time to defend herself. She uses her powers to break free from the Trix's attack, but they manage to escape. The Winx girls regroup, and Flora reveals that Stella's ring was safely replaced with an enchanted egg. Meanwhile, the Trix find the egg instead of the ring, which makes them even more determined to defeat the Winx. Bloom finishes getting ready for the ball, where she dances with Sky, marking the end of the episode.</p>

                <p>The girls are tasked with an exercise in the swamp, where they must escape the forest without using magic in three hours. As they struggle through the swamp, Bloom detects a foul smell, which leads them to discover dangerous gas trapped in bubbles. They quickly retreat to avoid the gas. Meanwhile, the Trix at Cloud Tower use an invisibility spell to skip class and plan to eliminate the captured troll before it can reveal their plans to the police.</p>
                <p>The Specialists are transferring the captured troll when the Trix attack, hoping to free the troll and prevent it from implicating them. The Winx girls find the crashed ship, but the troll escapes, leading to an argument between the Winx and the Specialists.

                <p>Bloom continues to have intense dreams about Daphne, who urges her to remember, causing Bloom to wake up talking in her sleep. Flora tells her it’s the Day of the Rose, a holiday where everyone celebrates their mothers. Flora and Tecna go home, while Musa, Bloom, and Stella stay at Alfea. Stella opens up about her parents’ divorce, and Musa shares that her mother passed away when she was young. The girls comfort each other, and Stella receives an invitation to the Rose Ball from Prince Sky.</p>
                <p>At Cloud Tower, Griffin scolds the Trix for breaking into Alfea, but sensing their negative energy, she gives them another chance instead of punishing them. Meanwhile, Musa spends the day alone at Alfea, reflecting on her mother, while Bloom and Stella go to Magix for the Rose Festival. After an argument with Riven, Bloom unknowingly gives him a helmet, disguised as a peace offering from Timmy, which is actually a hypno-gadget sent by the Trix to manipulate him.</p>
                <p>Riven loses control after the helmet is activated by Darcy, who heals him.

                <p>At night, Flora enters Stella’s room while she’s sleeping, telling her that Bloom is talking in her sleep again. They go to Bloom’s room, where she is having another prophetic dream about Daphne. As Bloom transforms in her sleep, Flora panics, and Stella shouts at her to be quiet, waking Bloom up in the process.</p>
                <p>The next day, the girls walk around Alfea, and Bloom discusses her dreams with Tecna, who analyzes them and suggests that the woman in her dreams is trying to send a message. Stella interrupts, dismissing Bloom’s concerns, which upsets Bloom, causing her to storm off to the library to find more information about Daphne.

Faragonda intervenes and orders the library closed, but after Bloom leaves, she inspects one of the books and orders Barbatea to shut down the library.</p>

                <p>Bloom is lost in thought about Daphne, and after being called by Stella several times, she snaps out of it and apologizes. The girls are discussing the simulation room, with Musa excited for the upcoming experience, Flora worried after hearing rumors about it, and Tecna reassuring her. Stella hopes to be the center of attention during the experience, but the others scold her, leading to a lighthearted moment.</p>
                <p>At Cloud Tower, the Trix decide to test Bloom after learning she has the Dragon's Flame. Knut questions why such a flame resides in a person, and Icy explains it will restore their lost glory. Meanwhile, Palladium takes the students to the simulation room and explains its capabilities. He reveals the final exam will involve either countering evil spells or restoring a barren environment, which surprises and excites the girls. Later, Bloom spends time with Brandon, discussing the test, and despite feeling unready, she is comforted by him.</p>

Afterward, she realizes Kiko is safe, and Palladium reveals that her powers caused the simulator to crash.

                <p>Stella complains about Flora's plants invading her space, causing a disruption in their shared room. Flora, feeling misunderstood, decides to leave for Black Mud Swamp to conduct her experiments in peace. The Winx, worried about her safety, follow her, and Flora explains she is searching for the Cheerful Gladiolus flower to help with her studies. As they explore the swamp, they accidentally disturb the Undines, water nymphs who are threatened by a monster on Black Island. The Winx decide to help the nymphs by locating Lusiz, who has gone missing while trying to gather a special plant for their homes.</p>
                <p>The Winx fly to the island and encounter the creature, which turns out to be a giant sleepwalking turtle. After rescuing Musa from the creature, they learn that the monster's behavior is linked to the Red Willow, a plant controlling the turtle’s sleepwalking. The Winx use their magic to defeat the Red Willow, with Bloom burning its roots and Flora dispelling it, purifying the air and saving the Undines. Lusiz explains the turtle will leave, allowing them to gather the Xilith plants they need for their homes, but Flora's rapid growth formula ensures they have enough for the future.</p>

Flora, knowing she’ll pass her exam, reassures the others she won’t take up too much space for her experiments.

                <p>During Bloom’s week-long vacation in Gardenia, she spends time with her parents, helping her mother in the kitchen and discovering her newfound ability to see auras. Bloom notices two suspicious men, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bonner, in her mother’s flower shop, and after using her aura-reading powers, she realizes they plan to take over the shop and turn it into a supermarket. Bloom warns her mother, and though the men try to convince Vanessa to sign over the business, she refuses. They retaliate by vandalizing the shop, escalating their threats over the following days.</p>
                <p>One night, Bloom has a vision of her mother’s shop on fire and wakes up in a panic, urging her family to rush there. When they arrive, the shop is burning, and Bloom bravely enters to protect her family with a magical shield.
